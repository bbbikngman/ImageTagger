GPT4o secrect key is nessary, you can bought from OpenAI officially or choose any cheaper proxy way that support image upload. I've attached an one dollar key in the programe so maybe you can try for free.

I tried to make an ios version but found my macbook 2017 is too old to compile any app for my iphone with ios 17.Damn, Only Apple can do.

Further plans:
I will add a Vocabulary book if  i have time.
